# Notes for 'Bayesian Machine Learning in Python: A/B Testing'

I've taken some notes from the course named "Bayesian Machine Learning in Python: A/B Testing " provided by Udemy.
 
I would like to thank LazyProgrammer for his detailed and clear explanations. 
His github page: https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples

You can reach my notes from [Bayesian_vs_Frequentist_Approach.md](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Bayesian-AB-Test/blob/master/Bayesian_vs_Frequentist_Approach.md), 
[Frequentist_AB_Testing.md](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Bayesian-AB-Test/blob/master/Frequentist_AB_Testing.md) and 
[Bayesian_AB_Testing.md](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Bayesian-AB-Test/blob/master/Bayesian_AB_Testing.md)

I've also added other resources to clarify some topics. 

There are some scripts about t_test, chi_square test and thompson sampling in the [scripts](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Bayesian-AB-Test/tree/master/scripts)
folder.
