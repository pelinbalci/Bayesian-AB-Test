# Notes from Bayesian Machine Learning in Python: A/B Testing 


I've taken some notes from the course named "Bayesian Machine Learning in Python: A/B Testing " provided by Udemy. 

I would like to thank LazyProgrammer for his detailed and clear explanations. 
You can reach his github pages from the link below.

You can reach my notes from [Bayesian_vs_Frequentist_Approach.md](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Bayesian-AB-Test/blob/master/Bayesian_vs_Frequentist_Approach.md) 

I will add other resources to clarify some topics.
